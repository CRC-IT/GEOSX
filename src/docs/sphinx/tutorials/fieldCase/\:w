Running a simple field case from scratch
########################################

In this tutorial, we present how to run a field case by incorporating iteratively different
physics, from a simple flow problem in a continuous media to a coupled poromechanics one
in a fractured media.

We consider the following mesh that will be the support for the simulations to come.

   :width: 400px

This mesh is composed of three different continuous regions.

  - Top region (overburden)
  - Middle region (reservoir layer)
  - Bottom region (underburden)

The mesh is defined in the GMSH file format (see :ref:`Meshes` page for fmore. Each tetrahedra has an elementary tag associated
